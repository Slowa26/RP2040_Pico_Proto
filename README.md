# RP2040_Pico_Proto

This repo will serve as a prototyping space for the Raspberry Pi Pico development board.

Information on the device can be found here:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/

More importantly, I hope to learn the ins and outs of Git by regularly maintaing this
repo as I develop and choose to share more junk.
